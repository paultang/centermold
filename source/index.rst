Dear Valued Customers and Partners,

Welcome to CenterMold!

With over 30 years of experience in mold design, tooling, and injection molding, it has been my honor to lead CenterMold in our mission to deliver custom molds and small-batch plastic parts to international clients. 


At CenterMold, we take pride in serving a diverse clientele that spans North America and Europe. Our customers include industry giants like Agilent, innovative high-tech companies in Southern California, and renowned equipment manufacturers in Germany. We also collaborate with numerous small and medium-sized mold and injection molding factories to provide exceptional service to clients in North America, Europe, and the UK.

CenterMold not only produce molds that meet export standards but also offer flexible small-batch production to meet our clients' unique needs. Each mold crafted by CenterMold is backed by our lifetime maintenance service.

Navigating the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, we stood by our clients, overcoming obstacles and continuing to provide top-tier service. This period tested our resilience and underscored the importance of strong, supportive relationships with our customers.

Understanding our clients' needs is paramount. Every year, I travel to North America and Europe to visit our clients, listen to their feedback, and gain insights into their evolving requirements. 

To our loyal customers, thank you for your support and trust. Your feedback and partnership have been instrumental in our growth and success. To potential clients, we look forward to work with you and demonstrate our commitment.


Together, let's build the future of :ref:`mold-design section` and :ref:`Injection-molding`.

Warm regards,

| Tony Tang
