Dear Valued Customers and Partners,

Welcome to CenterMold!

With over 30 years of experience in mold design, tooling, and injection molding, it has been my honor to lead CenterMold in our mission to deliver custom molds and small-batch plastic parts to international clients. Our journey began with a commitment to quality and customer satisfaction, principles that continue to guide us today.

At CenterMold, we take pride in serving a diverse clientele that spans North America and Europe. Our customers include industry giants like Agilent, innovative high-tech companies in Southern California, and renowned equipment manufacturers in Germany. We also collaborate with numerous small and medium-sized mold and injection molding factories to provide exceptional service to clients in North America, Europe, and the UK.

Our dedication to quality is reflected in every product we manufacture. We not only produce molds that meet export standards but also offer flexible small-batch production to meet our clients' unique needs. Each mold crafted by CenterMold is backed by our lifetime maintenance service, ensuring longevity and reliability.

Navigating the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, we stood by our clients, overcoming obstacles and continuing to provide top-tier service. This period tested our resilience and underscored the importance of strong, supportive relationships with our customers.

Understanding our clients' needs is paramount. Every year, I travel to North America and Europe to visit our clients, listen to their feedback, and gain insights into their evolving requirements. These interactions are invaluable, driving us to continually enhance our services and deliver superior molds and products.

To our loyal customers, thank you for your unwavering support and trust. Your feedback and partnership have been instrumental in our growth and success. To potential clients, we look forward to the opportunity to work with you and demonstrate the CenterMold commitment to excellence.

Together, let's build the future of mold design and injection molding.

Warm regards,

Tony Tang
Founder and General Manager
